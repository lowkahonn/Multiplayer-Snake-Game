# Multiplayer-Snake-Game
It is a two-player retro snake game, which brought us a lot of memories. 

How To Play:
Player 1 is white in colour, movement control keys are arrow keys.
Player 2 is green in colour, movement control keys are W,A,S and D.

There will only be one food at a time, where players compete to grow longer.
If two players collide each other in the head, the player with longer body wins!
If Player 1's head collide with Player 2's body, Player 1 loses!
If Player 2's head collide with Player 1's body, Player 2 loses!

The frame per second will increase with time, to escalate the excitement, so beware!

Give it a try! :)
